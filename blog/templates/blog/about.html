    <p class="lead">Why</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In a time when the world is fast becoming technological, and the prime of an
      Era of Artificial Intelligence is dawning with immense uncertainty for Humanity.
      We pride ourselves in bringing to our users, content that is aware, conscious, culturally
      diverse as well humane.
      It is through various forms of Media that the history of Human Culture has been preserved,
      and by observation we grow to learn & identify with the culture represented in the Media.
      This is why we strive to drive a gold-standard for Conscious Media, we believe in a better
      future. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">How</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Whilst the move from broadcast Media has seen Media been decentralized, and an increase in
      the ablity to share & connect instantaneously through individual experience. Content creation
      has become extremely personalized.
      But there has been an increase in online platforms, because
      there is a need for trusted safe spaces where content is a minefield and is filtered, focus & instantaneous.
      We provide user-experience based content that is complemented by our in-house content creators, who undergo
      various forms of training in aspects of Culture & Reality.
      Our in-house content creators also produce user-experience based content, including shared experiences.
